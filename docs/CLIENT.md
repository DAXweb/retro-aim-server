# AIM Client Setup

This guide explains how to install and configure AIM clients for Retro AIM Server.

## Installation

### Linux / FreeBSD

Windows AIM versions 5.0-5.1.3036 run perfectly well on [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/). Here's how to set up AIM
5.1.3036.

1. [Install Wine](https://wiki.winehq.org/Download)
2. Download the AIM installer from [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/aim513036)
3. Run the installer from the terminal:
   ```shell
   wine aim513036.exe
   ```

### macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon)

Windows AIM can run on modern macOS without a VM, including the Apple Silicon platform!

Get started with the [AIM for macOS project](https://github.com/mk6i/aim-for-macos).

### Windows 10/11

All versions of AIM 5.x run on Windows 10/11 with varying degrees of success. To get started, install AIM
[5.0.2829](http://www.oldversion.com/windows/aol-instant-messenger-5-0-2829). Set [Windows XP compatibility mode](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/make-older-apps-or-programs-compatible-with-windows-783d6dd7-b439-bdb0-0490-54eea0f45938)
on the executable once installed.

Newer 5.x versions exhibit a quirk where `aim.exe` randomly hangs on startup, which can be mitigated by [AIM Tamer](http://iwarg.ddns.net/phoenix/index.php?action=downloads).

## Configuration

Once installed, configure AIM to connect to Retro AIM Server.

1. At the sign-on screen, click `Setup`.
